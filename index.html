Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_United_Kingdom" class="body-link" target="_blank">post-war era British sports cars</a>, the MX-5 rejuvenated interest in roadsters after the demise of cars such as the MG B and Triumph Spitfire. Since its debut, the MX-5 has won numerous automotive awards and has become the world’s best selling sports car.</p>
